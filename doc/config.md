# Configuration of modbus2mqtt_2

*modbus2mqtt_2* supports two basic variants of configuration:

[Command line + .csv file (legacy and limited)](#command-line--csv-file)<br>
[YAML configuration file (new, with all features)](#yaml-configuration-file)<br>

Also have a look at the example configurations provided in the [config directory](config)


## Command line + .csv file

This is the original way of *spicierModbus2mqtt*. It is still supported, but doesn't offer all features, especially on HASS integration.<br>
Not recommended any longer.<br>
> Please note: Some configuration options changed from *spicierModbus2mqtt*. Also some of the defaults. Please review your command line when using this variant

### .csv file
For details see https://github.com/mbs38/spicierModbus2mqtt#configuration-file.

## YAML configuration file
All options can be set by a YAML file. The only command line option required is using `--config` to point to config file.

Command line option can be used to override options from the yaml config.

### Basic YAML structure
The YAML config has two main parts:

1. `Daemon:`
Here go all options that config the MQTT broker connection and the Modbus interface.<br>
It replaces all command line options.

2. `Devices:`
This is where the definition of devices, pollers and references go.<br>
It replaces the .csv file.<br>

The overall YAML structure looks like this

    Daemon:
      daemon-option: value
      daemon-option: value
      daemon-option: value

    Devices:

      - name: device-1
        device-option: value
        device-option: value
        device-option: value
        Pollers:
          - start-reg: 0x0200 # First poller of first device
            poller-option: value
            poller-option: value
            poller-option: value
            References:
              - topic: topic1
                start-reg: 0x0200
                reference-option: value
              - topic: topic2
                start-reg: 0x0201
                reference-option: value
          - start-reg: 0x0400 # Second poller of first device
            References:
              - topic: topic1
                start-reg: 0x0400
              - topic: topic2
                start-reg: 0x0401

      - name: device-2
        Pollers:
          - start-reg: 0x0200 # First poller of second device
            References:
              - topic: topic
              - topic: topic2-2
          - start-reg: 0x0400 # Second poller of second device
            References:
              - topic: topic1
                start-reg: 0x0400
              - topic: topic2
                start-reg: 0x0401


### YAML `Daemon:` options
Below all daemon options and their default values. For a short description for the individual values, see the command line section above.

    Daemon:
      rtu: null
      tcp: null
      mqtt-host: localhost
      mqtt-port: null
      mqtt-user: null
      mqtt-pass: ''
      mqtt-use-tls: false
      mqtt-insecure: false
      mqtt-cacerts: null
      mqtt-tls-version: null
      mqtt-topic: modbus/
      publish-seconds: 300
      retain-values: false
      rtu-baud: 19200
      rtu-parity: even
      tcp-port: 502
      set-modbus-timeout: 1.0
      avoid-fc6: false
      diagnostics-rate: 0
      add-to-homeassistant: false
      hass-discovery-prefix: homeassistant

### YAML `Devices:` options
    Devices:
    - name: null
      slave-id: null

### YAML `Pollers:` options
      Pollers:
      - start-reg: null
        len-regs: 1
        reg-type: coil
        poll-rate: 15.0

### YAML `References:` options
        References:
        - topic: null
          start-reg: null
          write-reg: null
          readable: true
          writeable: false
          data-type: null
          scaling: null
          format-str: null
          hass_entity_type: null

### Setting default values
For `Pollers:` and `References:`, default options can be set in the hierarchy one level above by prepending `Default-` to any option. For example:

    Devices:
      - name: device-1
        device-option: value
        Default-poller-option: default-value-for-pollers-below
        Pollers:
          - start-reg: 0x0200 # First poller of first device
            poller-option: value
            Default-reference-option: default-value-for-references-below
            References:

See the [example config file for WAGO I/O](/config/wago-352-530-430.yaml). It illustrates quite well how one can write compact config files by using the default mechanism.

## Home Assistant Options (HASS)
The following options are only required if one has enabled HASS integration.
For simplicity, just some snippets from the code are provided.
For more extensive information on the options, please see the HASS documentation of the MQTT integration and discovery (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery)

See also the [example config file for Eastron power meter](/config/eastron-sdm72.yaml). There you can see how one could use the additional HASS options.
